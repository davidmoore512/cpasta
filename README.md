# cpasta
Rofi script to paste frequently used text into current window.

In my work I frequently need to respond to emails in about 5 or 6 different ways. Most of the responses are fairly long but identical with the exception of a few words like a person's name or username.

I was using a clipboard manager in Gnome that allowed me to save copies and star them for future use.

I switched to using XFCE desktop and the clipman tool did not work well for this task.

I got the idea to use rofi after using a rofi emoji picker created by [tadly](https://gist.github.com/tadly/0741821d3694deaec1ee454a95c591fa) and forked by [omc8db](https://gist.github.com/omc8db/d95462784bc1c5c41f7f489df5dbc377).

This version works for me using Debian 12 and XFCE, I think it will not work in wayland without some modification.
